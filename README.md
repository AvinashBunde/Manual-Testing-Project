# Manual-Testing-Project
My testing approach for the CURA Healthcare Service website demonstrates a structured and comprehensive methodology. It involves thorough test case and scenario development, cross-platform and cross-device testing, detailed reporting, organized test case management, and seamless integration with project management and defect tracking processes. This approach helps ensure the quality and reliability of the website's healthcare and hospital-related functionalities, ultimately delivering a better user experience to the end-users.

1. Test Case Coverage:
Develop comprehensive test cases and scenarios to ensure thorough testing of all critical functionalities and user flows related to healthcare and hospital services on the CURA website.
Focus on testing the HomePage, LoginPage, and Book Appointment Page, as these are the website's main pages.
Create test cases to validate positive, negative, and edge cases for each functionality, ensuring a well-rounded testing approach.

2. Cross-Platform Testing:
Execute the test cases and scenarios on multiple platforms and environments to ensure compatibility and consistent functionality.
Test on popular web browsers like Chrome and Edge to identify any browser-specific issues or rendering problems.
Extend testing to mobile devices, ensuring the website is responsive and provides a seamless user experience across various screen sizes and form factors.

3. Defect Tracking and Reporting:
Maintain detailed records of all defects or issues encountered during testing, including steps to reproduce, severity levels, and any additional relevant information.
Utilize Jira as the defect tracking tool to log and manage defects, enabling effective collaboration and communication with the development team.
Generate comprehensive test reports after each testing cycle, documenting the test cases executed, their results (pass/fail), and any additional observations or recommendations.

4. Continuous Improvement:
Review and analyze the test cases, scenarios, and testing approach to identify areas for improvement or optimization.
