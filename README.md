# Manual-Testing-Project
I perform manual testing for the CURA Healthcare Service website,focusing on healthcare and hospital-related functionalities. The website has three main Pages: HomePage, LoginPage, and Book Appointment Page.My testing approach involves writing comprehensive test cases and scenarios, executing them on Chrome, Edge, and mobile devices, and generating test reports.I utilize Excel for test case and scenario management, while Jira is employed for project management and defect logging.
